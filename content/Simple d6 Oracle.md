title: Simple d6 Oracle
---

A simple [[Roll Table|Oracle Table]]. Using a single [[d6|d6]], get a yes/no answer to a question.

| d6  | Result   |
| --- | -------- |
| 6   | Yes, and |
| 5   | Yes      |
| 4   | Yes, but |
| 3   | No, but  |
| 2   | No       |
| 1   | No, and  |

You can adjust the odds as needed, such as [[Advantage & Disadvantage|Rolling With Advantage]] if you think an answer is more likely (or disadvantage if it isn't).

The main advantage of this oracle is its speed: a single die, easy to remember answers. You can roll it mid sentence and get the answer fast enough to keep talking without breaking your flow.
