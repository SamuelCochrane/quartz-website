What's interesting/important about the Prisoner's Dilemma is **how inaccurate it is to real life**. PD suggests altruism is illogical, but cooperative behavior is overwhelmingly the dominant strategy - it's the norm. 

So, the critical question is _why_ the Prisoner's Dilemma is a bad [[model|model]] for looking at cooperation in general. 

### Reasons It Might Be a Bad Model

It assumes no communication between A & B: They cannot strategize, beg, or haggle.

It assumes that both [[Agent|Agent]]s have [[Rational Self Interest|Rational Self Interest]] and will logically optimize for their score, when it could instead be closer to [[./The Scorpion And The Frog|The Scorpion And The Frog]].

Most critically, **it assumes that the knowledge of their actions won't leave this game.** 

It assumes a 1-step game: A & B will never play this game with each other again.
Prisoner A won't "get a reputation" as an aggressor. 

The Prisoners Dilemma assumes Prisoner A won't get shanked by Prisoner B's gang once they get out. [[Snitches Get Stitches|Snitches Get Stitches]], don't they?

Life seems to be closer to an [[Iterated Prisoners Dilemma|Iterated Prisoners Dilemma]]. It models human behavior more accurately in most scenarios.
