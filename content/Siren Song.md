>Come closer, famous Odysseusâ€”Achaeaâ€™s pride and gloryâ€” 
>moor your ship on our coast so you can hear our song!
>Never has any sailor passed our shores in his black craft
>until he has heard the honeyed voices pouring from our lips
>â€” Book XII,Â _The Odyssey_

A Siren Song has become a generic term for temptation, and the way you deal with it is to [[Ulysses Pact|Tie Yourself To The Mast]].

> [!note]- The Odyssey: Book XII
> In The Odyssey, Odysseus/Ulysses must pass through water infested with Sirens. The goddess Circe tells him toÂ **stuff his crewâ€™s ears with softened beeswax**Â so that no one can hear them.
> When Ulysses mentions his curiosity to hear what the Sirens have to say, she tells him to have his men tie him to the mast of the ship so he can't act. The crew are explicitly told to ignore any pleading gestures he makes to be released. 
> Once he hears the sirens, he goes mad and begs his crew to release him, which they don't do. Thus, they safely get through the waters.

These days, a lot of advice for dealing with tough situations is focused around [[Willpower|Willpower]], at the ability to be tough enough to get through any challenge.
So much so that we forget the basic fact of this story:

>[!warning] Ulysses _didn't_ withstand the siren's call. 

He lost and gave in completely. The only thing that saved him was his lack of power to take action. 

If anything, the story seems to be a warning **against** using [[Willpower|Willpower]]/[[Discipline|Discipline]] to get through tough situations. By intentionally limiting his own freedom, Odysseus is able to avoid giving into temptation. **Not** because he had the willpower to resist, but because he did not have the _means_ to act.

The message is clear: When it's time to make the choice, you'll make the wrong one. So remove the choice. [[Ulysses Pact|Tie Yourself To The Mast]].
