title: Highly interlinked ideas naturally get repeated more often

[[What Gets Repeated Gets Remembered|What Gets Repeated Gets Remembered]], but why do some things get repeated more often?

Let's say you're having a conversation with a friend about various topics A, B, C, and so on - and you notice topic A keeps coming up. (figure 1)

If we plot out all these ideas on a [[Graph view|Graph view]] with connections between related topics, we will see that A is related to _many_ of the others. (figure 2)

So, our conversation was just a [[Random Walk Through A Graph|Random Walk Through A Graph]]. As we bounced around the different nodes, we kept arriving back at one highly interconnected node. (figure 3)

Topic A coming up naturally in conversation over and over is just our subjective _linear_ experience of a highly connected node on a graph.
