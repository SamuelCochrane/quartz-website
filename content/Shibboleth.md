> And the Gileadites took the passages of Jordan before the Ephraimites: and it was so, that when those Ephraimites which were escaped said, Let me go over; that the men of Gilead said unto him, **Art thou an Ephraimite? If he said, Nay; Then said they unto him, Say now _Shibboleth_: and he said _Sibboleth_: for he could not frame to pronounce it right.** Then they took him, and slew him at the passages of Jordan

A Shibboleth acts as a shared, community-wide password that separates out the [[In Group & Out Group|In Group & Out Group]]. 
The mere fact you have the capability to answer correctly is enough to validate you.

[[meme|meme]]s act as shibboleths. If you laugh at me saying "_And They Were **Roommates**_" or "_Uh, yeah, I sure **hope** it does_", I know we have some shared cultural context and how to get along with you along those lines. [[If you know, you know|If you know, you know]].

Shibboleths are time and context based, and can expire. 

If you say "_When does the narwhal bacon? At midnight._" you authenticate yourself as someone who was a reddit user in 2011, but not necessarily one who uses it today. 
Or, since it's now common knowledge, someone who's just heard of it through [[Cultural Osmosis|Cultural Osmosis]]. Ironically, the word **Shibboleth** itself is no longer an effective shibboleth.
