While both are members of [[The Working Class|The Working Class]] who are controlled by [[The Owning Class|The Owning Class]], Serfs differ from [[Slave|Slave]]s in a few key ways.

Serfs have basic legal rights. 
- They can marry, be baptized, and cannot be murdered by their Landlord (unlike a [[Slave|Slave]], where it'd be closer legally to killing a cow).

Serfs are bound to the land, not a person.
- In a sense, a Serf is owned by the land they live on.
- Serfs cannot being forcibly relocated to a new plot of land like a [[Slave|Slave]] could. 
- Serfs have Landlords, who currently own the land, but do not own the Serf themselves.
- Serfs change hands by the changing of Landlords, like an apartment complex being bought by a different company.

Serfs own their excess labor. 
- All production by a [[Slave|Slave]] is owned by the Master (who can decide to give some of the food back to let them feed themselves)
- Serfs have an obligation to work (graze the cattle, farm the land, pay the rent), but that is it.
- As long as they pay rent on the land, they can keep the remaining harvest to themselves.[^1]
[^1]: (Although, in practice, there wont be much extra to keep - if there regularly is, the landlord will simply raise the rent)
