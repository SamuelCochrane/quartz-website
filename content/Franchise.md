Once a business has been "figured out" and distilled into a repeatable set of [[Recipe|Recipe]]s, it is ready to be sold as a Franchise.

A **franchisee**, the person purchasing the "prefab business" is in charge of one thing: executing the recipes. 
Sourcing product, marketing material, training guides - all have been created for them and simply need to be executed on. There is nothing for them to "figure out".

A **franchiser**, on the other hand, is responsible for the creation of [[Recipe|Recipe]]s but _not_ the execution of them. 
This can cause problems due to the lack of [[stakes|stakes]], and their lack of knowledge of the real problems you face when trying to execute on these templates. (Think: Ivory tower, with no knowledge of the real-world problems.)
On the other hand, it can be a good role for someone who's great at figuring new things out, but not on the repeated execution of them - such as adults with [[ADHD|ADHD]] (see: [[./Franchising and ADHD|Franchising and ADHD]]).

For the actual content that makes this up, see [[Content Of A Franchise|Content Of A Franchise]].
