title: There Is No Timeline For Grief
---

When [[./Coping With Loss|Coping With Loss]], it's understandable to get [[sick and tired of being sick and tired|sick and tired of being sick and tired]] and want to know when it will end. 
But it is difficult to impossible to put a timeline on [[Processing Pain|Processing Pain]].

There's a good chance you will generally fall into [[5 Stages Of Grief|5 Stages Of Grief]] (denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance).
However, [[Progress Isn't Linear|Progress Isn't Linear]]. You can and will circle back to previous 'stages'. You'll be fine, then devastated. 

This is because ==**Grief is a series of loops**==, where a little bit is processed each time. 
One day may be about processing that you'll never be able to cook for them again, another may be over the stuffed animals they left behind. 

Each little [[./Atomic Content|Atomic]] chunk needs processing, and it is hard to know how many chunks there are before you're done.
