[[Things have an essential nature|Things have an essential nature]] which cannot be changed, **even if doing so seems like it would benefit them**.

[[./The Scorpion And The Frog|The Scorpion And The Frog]]. The scorpion stung the frog because that's what scorpions do. A scorpion that doesn't sting frogs is no scorpion at all. 


It appears to go against [[Rational Self Interest|Rational Self Interest]] at first. He could have acted differently and everything would have been fine.

I think this story only makes sense in the context of a [[model|model]] where one's nature _is_ their existence. A smoker that quits smoking is no longer a smoker, they've lost that identity. You can't have a smoker that doesn't smoke. 

[[Things lobby for their own existence|Things lobby for their own existence]], and the smoker doesn't want to stop existing.
