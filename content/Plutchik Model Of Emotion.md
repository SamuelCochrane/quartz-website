title: Plutchik Model Of Emotion

A [[Model Of Human Emotion|Model Of Human Emotion]] that works by combining emotions, like a color palette that combines primary colors to get secondary colors.

From these core emotions you can derive compound emotions (called Dyads) by combining two felt emotions at once.

#### Opposed Dyads - Rarely Felt

Any three-away emotions (directly opposed) are felt as _conflict_. (e.g. feeling joy and sadness). I've created my own potential names for these.

| Dyad           | Core 1       | Core 2            |
| ----------- | -------- | ------------ |
| Bittersweet | joy      | sadness      |
| ?           | trust    | disgust      |
| Righteous Indignation           | fear     | anger        |
| ?           | surprise | anticipation |
