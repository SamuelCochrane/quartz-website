>[!quote] The Scorpion & The Frog
> One day, a scorpion asks a frog to carry him across a river. 
> The frog is hesitant, because he knows that scorpions sting and kill frogs.
> The scorpion assures him that he won't sting, because then they'd both drown. 
> The frog agrees and halfway across the river, the scorpion stings him. 
> As the frog feels the venom coursing through his body, he asks the scorpion why he did it.
> The scorpion replies, "It's just in my nature."

The moral of the story is that sometimes an [[Agent|Agent]],  like the [[Scorpion|Scorpion]], can make decisions that go against [[Rational Self Interest|Rational Self Interest]]. 

Like it or not, [[./It Is Their Nature|It Is Their Nature]].

The math is very different from the [[./Prisoners Dilemma|Prisoners Dilemma]], as the most optimal score is awarded for cooperation.

|                            | **Frog Helps**             | **Frog Doesn't Help**    |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Scorpion Stings**        | Frog: -100 <br> Scorpion: -95 | Frog: -100 <br> Scorpion: +5 |
| **Scorpion Doesn't Sting** | Frog: 0 <br> Scorpion: +10   | Frog: 0 <br> Scorpion: 0     |

Your nature just got you killed you stupid [[Scorpion|Scorpion]]. Why would you do that?

It also makes you wonder about the frog. 
What did they even gain from helping? Why bother taking the risk? 

Maybe it's just [[./It Is Their Nature|in their nature]] to want to help.
