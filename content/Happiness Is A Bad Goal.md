title: Happiness Is A Bad Goal
---

> "Happiness isnâ€™t a goalâ€¦ itâ€™s a by-product of a life well lived." 
> -- Eleanor Roosevelt

[[Happiness|Happiness]] is a bad [[goal|goal]] to directly aim for. Focus instead on improving your conditions, and happiness will naturally arrive.

### Desire Is Antithetical

[[goal|Goal]]s are driven by [[Dopamine|Dopamine]], and [[Dopamine Is The Desire Chemical, Not The Happiness Chemical|Dopamine Is The Desire Chemical, Not The Happiness Chemical]].
This is why [[It's the Getting, Not The Having|Achieving Your Goals Isn't As Fun As You Expect]].

[[Desire Is The Root Of All Suffering|Desire Is The Root Of All Suffering]], after all.

You're probably seeking something closer to [[Gratitude|Gratitude]], which is regulated by the [[Here & Now|Here & Now]] chemicals and is specifically characterized by a _lack_ of external desire.

### Happiness is a By-product

Contentment comes about when your [[./Hierarchy Of Needs|Hierarchy Of Needs]] is well-handled. Handling that will naturally result in more happiness than directly "trying to be more happy" will.

[[When a metric becomes a goal it ceases to be a good metric|When a metric becomes a goal it ceases to be a good metric]]. The feeling of happiness itself is fleeting. If you directly aim at increasing it, you'll be over-tuned to fluctuations. You freak out about having a bad day.

>[!quote]- The Mirage On The Sea Of Sadness
> Imagine happiness as a place where happy people are happy all the time. This turns happiness into an unreachable feeling of constant bliss that no one has.

>True happiness is like a bird that might land on your ship, but not if you constantly stand guard to catch it. If you improve your ship and sail into warmer waters -- the bird will land when you aren't looking.
> 
>So be sure never to do that. Aim toward the mirage of happiness rather than improving the ship upon which you sail.
