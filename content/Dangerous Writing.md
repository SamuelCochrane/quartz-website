> [!summary] Dangerous Writing
> A style of [[Writing|Writing]] in which, if you stop, everything you've written so far is deleted.

Dangerous Writing can be a powerful tool for overcoming [[Writer's Block|Writer's Block]] and fostering [[Creativity|Creativity]]. 

By eliminating the option to pause or delete, it forces writers to keep their thoughts [[Flow|Flowing]]. There's no time overthink or edit.

This can lead to more authentic and raw writing, allowing ideas to flow freely without inhibition. [[./Write Drunk, Edit Sober|Write Drunk, Edit Sober]].

If you stop typing for more than five seconds, all progress will be lost. This loss avoidance helps keep you going. [[Pain Is Stronger Than Pleasure|Pain Is A Stronger Motivator Than Pleasure]].
