A note-taking system where each note was limited to the space of a physical 3x5 index card. [[./Atomic Content Should Fit On A Single Page|Atomic Content Should Fit On A Single Page]].

These [[Atomic Notes|Atomic Notes]] then had written links to other related notes, creating a [[Graph Database|Graph Database]] of interlinked ideas.

While the original Zettelkasten was physical, most [[Knowledge Management Tool|Knowledge Management Tool]]s these days are fully digital. 

As a note tool for thought, it's a bit like cultivating a [[./Digital Garden|Digital Garden]] more than it is writing a book.

### Origin

Modeled after the human brain, (or rather, a [[model|model]] _of_ the human brain), in which densely interconnected neurons become [[more than the sum of their parts|more than the sum of their parts]], and [[./Highly interlinked ideas naturally get repeated more often|Highly interlinked ideas naturally get repeated more often]].

Invented by German sociologist Niklas Luhmann, who wrote over 70 published books. That, to me, is evidence of the effectiveness of this system.
