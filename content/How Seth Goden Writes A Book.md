title: How Seth Goden Writes a Book
---

[[Seth Goden|Seth Goden]]'s book [[The Practice|The Practice]] follows a simple structure: 

There are 219 titled chapters split across 8 Sections. 
Each chapter is a single page, no more than 300 words.
That's it. 
219 new ideas, one on page each.

>[!example]- Example chapters
> 6. _Learning to Juggle_ - 26 sentences, 284 words
> 7. _How to Draw an Owl_ - 14 sentences, 150 words + a picture
> 8. _Does It Take Courage to Be Creative?_ - 14 sentences, 203 words
> 9. _This Is Art_ - 15 sentences, 200 words + a quoted paragraph
> 10. _Perhaps You Can Make Some Art_ - 12 sentences, 172 words

Seth practices what he preaches. His blog is one idea, written every day. It's the `Practice` that he talks about in this book.

Seth writes using an [[Atomic Notes|Atomic Notes]] structure. Each idea is 300 words or less so it can [[./Atomic Content Should Fit On A Single Page|Fit On A Single Page]]. 

Seth then uses a [[./Pages and Notes Structure|Pages and Notes Structure]] to organize things. He arranges the 219 ideas into groupings which represent overarching ideas like "Earn Your Skills". The book is simply a collection of those groupings.

His blog is, frankly, indistinguishable in quality from the book, but people[^1] still happily [[You Pay For The Linear Walkthrough Of The Graph|Paid For The Linear Walkthrough Of The Graph]].
