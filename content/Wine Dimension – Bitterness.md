title: Wine Dimension – Bitterness
---

One of the [[Dimensions Of Wine#Core Dimensions|Dimensions Of Wine > Core Dimensions]].

Bitterness, usually referred to as **Tannin**.

>[!note] Drying, not Dry.
> High amounts of Tannin will make your mouth feel dry, but that doesn't mean it makes a wine “dry”. 
> A Dry wine specifically means one that's low-[[Wine Dimension – Sweetness|Sweetness/Sugar]].

> Tannin is a bit like the “feels like” temperature caused by windchill. It feels colder than it actually is.

### Color

Tannin is usually present in the skins of fruit (like grape skin), and so is present along with more color. A red wine has grape skins, and so has tannin – white wines have the skins removed, and have little to no tannin. 

>[!warning] Tannin = Color = Bitterness
>Tannin is the thing _tanning_ your wine. More color means more tannin.
>Red wines are more bitter than white wines. 

Tannins in wine can also come from wood storing (oak aging).

### Aging

A wine with very strong tannins is often better when aged. Years of storing in a bottle will soften the tannins. 
This is why a finely aged wine usually means a red wine, because aging specifically affects the red parts of it.

### Health

Tannin is present in skins as an insect & pest repellant. 

In humans, they are antioxidant and antibacterial. This is why you may have seen a doctors recommendation to drink 1 glass of _Red_ wine a day.
