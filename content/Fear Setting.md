> If you are nervous about making the jump or simply putting it off out of fear of the unknown, here is your antidote. 
> â€“ Tim Ferriss

A technique by [[Tim Ferris|Tim Ferris]] to help clarify and overcome your fears. It seems to be an implimentation of [[Cognitive Behavioral Therapy|CBT]] techniques like the "3 Cs" ([[Cognitive Behavioral Therapy#Catch it, Check it, and Change it|Catch it, Check it, and Change it]]).

Creating clarity over the worst that can actually happen reduces [[Anxiety|Anxiety]]. [[Is This The Condition That I Feared|Is This The Condition That I Feared]]? Or, can I manage it.

[[Mastery Over Fear|Mastery Over Fear]] is critical. [[What we fear doing most is usually what we most need to do|What we fear doing most is usually what we most need to do]]. 

### Procedure

Write and do not editâ€”aim for volume. Spend a few minutes on each answer.

Worst case
1. **Define** Your Nightmare: Write down the absolute worst that could happen if this happened. Envision doubts, fears, and potential negative outcomes in detail. Assess their permanence and likelihood on a scale of 1-10.

2. **Plan** for Damage Control: Consider how you could repair any potential damage or setbacks, even if temporarily. Realize that it might be easier than you imagine to get things back on track.

Average case
1. **Visualize** Probable Outcomes: Think about the more likely outcomes, both positive and negative, temporary and permanent, that could result from taking action. Rate their impact on a scale of 1-10 and recognize that achieving a moderately good outcome is likely.

Avoidance case
4. **Calculate** the Cost of Inaction: Assess the financial, emotional, and physical toll of NOT taking action, of the status-quo being preserved. Visualize where you'll be in one year, five years, and ten years if you don't pursue what excites you.

Review
5. **Face** Your Fears: Acknowledge what you're putting off out of fear and recognize that often, what you fear doing most is what you most need to do. Resolve to do one thing every day that scares you, and understand that growth comes from uncomfortable conversations and actions.
8. **Overcome** Fear and Take Action: Stop waiting for the perfect moment. Realize that inaction carries the greatest risk of all. Measure the cost of not acting, understand that most missteps are repairable, and develop the habit of taking action.
