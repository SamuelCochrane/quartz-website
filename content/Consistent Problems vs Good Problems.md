title: Consistent Problems vs Good Problems
---

Humans like solving problems, it feels good. We like feeling useful to others, and we like feeling like we're making progress towards making the world a better place.

However, [[You'll Always Have The Same Number Of Problems|You'll Always Have The Same Number Of Problems]]. So, it's important to make sure you're [[./North Star-ing|North Star-ing]] that the problems you're working so hard to solve are really [[Something Worth Dying For|Something Worth Dying For]]. 

Without a [[heuristic|heuristic]] to sort problems by, you'll probably just fall into working on whatever problems are presented to you as the most immediate and obvious. [[If you don't pick your goals, society will pick them for you|If you don't pick your goals, society will pick them for you]].

### Consistent Problems

Emotional Distress Problems -> People with [[White Knight Syndrome|White Knight Syndrome]] are perfect targets for [[Energy Vampire|Energy Vampire]]s that generate constant drama and distress.

Complex Problems -> [[Mystery Box Bullshit|Mystery Box Bullshit]] that, by virtue of being a complex, can always feel like progress is being made towards untangling the knot and solving things once and for all. 

Impossible Problems -> [[Gravity Problem|Gravity Problem]]s that simply can't be solved.

### Good Problems

Good problems get you closer to your [[goal|goal]], they change the status quo once solved. They provide [[Leverage|Leverage]], things are _significantly_ changed via their resolution. 

### Which is Which

To determine the kind of problem you're facing, [[Begin With The End In Mind|Begin With The End In Mind]]. 
- What would solving it actually get you? 
- Is this something that can actually be solved?
- Is it important, or just urgent?

For everything that doesn't make the cut, cultivate ambivalence. Sometimes it's just [[Not My Problem|Not My Problem]]. 

[[Not Caring Is A Superpower|Not Caring Is A Superpower]] that leaves you energy to focus on what actually matters.
