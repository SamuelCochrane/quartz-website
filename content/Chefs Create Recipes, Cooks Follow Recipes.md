title: Chefs Create Recipes, Cooks Follow Recipes
---

Both are [[Professional|Professionals]] that create a tangible output every day. 
They both require a [[Meez|Meez]] that allows for consistent daily work.

But when they make food, cooks follow a [[Recipe|Recipe]].

Cooks are industrialists that know that  [[Every task is a compiler|Every task is a compiler]]. They take inputs and turn them into outputs. They do this consistently. People depend on that consistency.

Sometimes, _most_ times actually, you just need a loaf of bread. 
It's not a problem if it was made the same way using the same recipe as the last one you bought. Better, actually.

Knowing what you're getting allows you to focus on other things. [[Consistency and dependability reduce complexity|Consistency and dependability reduce complexity]].

Chefs don't use recipes. 

They can't, because [[./There Is No Recipe For New Things|There Is No Recipe For New Things]]. 
They are there to create something new, because for them [[Figuring Out How To Do Something Is More Fun Than Doing It|Figuring Out How To Do Something Is More Fun Than Doing It]].

They are the ones that [[Go Slay The Dragon, Get The Gold, Share It With The Community|Go Slay The Dragon, Get The Gold, Share It With The Community]]. Without them, there would be no recipes.

Both are needed. Both have different audiences, different [[goal|goal]]s.
