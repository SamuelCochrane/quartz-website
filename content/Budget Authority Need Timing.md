If they don't have all 4, it'll be hard to close the opportunity.

**Budget** - can they provide what *you* need out of the transaction? 

**Authority** - are they the actual [[Above The Line & Below The Line|ATL]] decision maker? Even if they want to make a deal, _can_ they?

**Need** - What is their [[Motivation|Motivation]] and how strong is it? Are those things that you can actually provide?

**Timing** - Can they act now? If not, when? Sooner is better, [[Time Kills All Deals|Time Kills All Deals]].
