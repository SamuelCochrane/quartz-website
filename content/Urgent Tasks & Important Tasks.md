title: Urgent Tasks & Important Tasks
---

### Urgency & Importance

1. Urgency - How _bad_ is it if I _don't_ do it.
2. Importance - How _good_ is it if I _do_ do it.

Urgency & Importance are functions of [[Pain & Pleasure|Pain & Pleasure]].

Importance requires a [[goal|goal]]. A thing that feels good to move toward.
Urgency requires a whip. A thing that feels bad to get.

### Prioritization

Without deliberate [[Prioritize|Prioritization]], urgent tasks take over. 

[[Pain Is Stronger Than Pleasure|Pain Is Stronger Than Pleasure]], and without a clear [[goal|goal]] the importance of a task is hazy.

If [[Leadership|Leadership]] has not set a vision, then the only goal people have is "do what my manager tells me to do so I don't get fired". It's a [[Lose Lose Scenario|Lose Lose Scenario]].

Ideally, we have a life spent [[Maximize Happiness Rather Than Minimizing Pain|Maximize Happiness Rather Than Minimizing Pain]]. 

### Determining Urgency & Importance

- If I simply don't do this work, does anything happen?
- If I do it, [[What's In It For Me|What's In It For Me]]?
- If it needs to get done, do I need to be the one to do it?
