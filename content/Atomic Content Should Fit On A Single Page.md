title: Atomic Content Should Fit On A Single Page
fileClass:
  - Note
---

The goal of an [[Atomic Notes|Atomic Note]] is to fully contain a single idea. But, if a note is long enough you have to scroll to see everything, then you can never see the whole idea at once. [[Object Permanence|If I can't see it, it doesn't exist]]

The exact length to target will depend on the form:

- Physical [[./Zettelkasten|Zettelkasten]]s use 3x5 index cards.
- Published books generally contain 250-300 words per page, although this will decrease on pages with titles and images.
- [[Atomic Code|Atomic Code]] should be less than 20 lines long. 

---

This is a guideline, not a hard rule. Sometimes one idea requires a thousand words; So be it. 
[[./Atomic Content|Atomic]] means _indivisible_, not small. A Uranium atom is much bigger than a hydrogen atom.

Still, the longer it gets, the more likely it is to do multiple things and contain multiple ideas. If the length exceeds this [[heuristic|heuristic]], consider [[Splitting Out Atomic Content|Splitting It Out]].
