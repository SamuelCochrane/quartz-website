title: Gods Are Ways To Anthropomorphize Abstract Systems
---

A God is a way for humans to anthropomorphize the abstract and unknowable. They present a simplified [[model|model]], an abstraction, that act as a 'face' for something much more complex.

[[You never truly know anyone else, just a model of them in your head|You never truly know anyone else, just a model of them in your head]].  The same basic system can be grafted onto nature. 

The ocean is vast and uncaring, but Poseidon is a person who wants things and can be counted on to act in certain ways. 

Gods are _not_ the universal and infinite thing in-and-of itself. 
They are just [[model|model]]s, which live and die based on how useful they are.

This means they are not immortal, and [[The Death of God|The Death of God]] occurs when the model is no longer useful enough to be believed at large.

This also means different cultures and time periods had different gods that had different personalities, despite all being aspects of the same primordial concepts like "death" or "the ocean". Culture informed the model.
