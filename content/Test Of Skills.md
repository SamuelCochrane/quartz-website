A way of playing out a whole [[Narrative|Narrative]] scene using [[Dice Check|Dice Check]]s. 

Once you reach 3 total successes or 3 total failures, the scene is over. ([[Three Strikes You're Out|Three Strikes You're Out]]).

As you pass/fail each check, you can imagine what that means for the scene, what is/isn't working.

There are 6 possible outcomes for the scene, which can be mapped to a [[./Simple d6 Oracle|Simple d6 Oracle]]. 

| Result                      | Outcome                                                  |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| 3 Successes, <br>0 Failures | "Yes, and... " <br>Great success deserving some boon     |
| 3 Successes, <br>1 Failures | "Yes" <br>Standard Success                               |
| 3 Successes, <br>2 Failures | "Yes, but..." <br>It worked, but just barely.            |
| 3 Failures, <br>2 Successes | "No, but..." <br>You lost, but just barely.              |
| 3 Failures, <br>1 Successes | "No" Standard Failure                                    |
| 3 Failures, <br>0 Successes | "No, and..." <br>Terrible failure deserving some penalty |

### Implementations

4th edition [[D&D|D&D]] had Skill Challenges, where you needed a certain number of passes before hitting 3 failures.

- [Trials Reforged](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rWjGO23kSJzj1wDpZq3iC8ukUBh1J2_W/view)

[[Ironsworn|Ironsworn]]: Starforged has Scene Challenges.

Both of these implement a model where you have a static number of failures that result in a loss, but a variable number of successes needed to pass. I wonder about that. Isn't a higher DC the thing that takes care of difficulty? Why would I put a lower DC but a higher # of passes needed?
