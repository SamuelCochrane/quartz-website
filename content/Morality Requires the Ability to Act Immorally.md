> You can't bench 225 if you're completely morally reprehensible. [^1]

There's a classic [[meme|meme]] that if someone gained invisibility, the first thing they'd do is go peep on the women's locker room. 
It isn't their [[morality|morality]] that stops them from doing this today - it's their lack of ability.

**A weak person is not a moral person.** Just because they _don't_ do something bad, doesn't mean they _wouldn't_. 

This is one reason [[Absolute Power Corrupts Absolutely|Absolute Power Corrupts Absolutely]]. It's just revealing the person that was already there.

[[The Meek|The Meek]] shall inherit the earth because they are dangerous enough to _choose_ peace.
