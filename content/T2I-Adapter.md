title: T2I-Adapter
---

T2I-Adapter is an injection-based SD control, an additional model that can sit "in front" of a [[Stable Diffusion|Stable Diffusion]] model to help control the outputs. See their [Overview on Github](https://github.com/TencentARC/T2I-Adapter/blob/main/docs/coadapter.md).

T2I-Adapter is similar to [[ControlNet|ControlNet]], allowing you to define a depth-map, outline, etc for your [[Stable Diffusion|Stable Diffusion]] model's output.

### Unique Features

T2I seems to do a lot of the same things as [[ControlNet|ControlNet]], and I haven't yet explored the differences.

One unique feature for now is allowing for a style image as input _(not currently supported by [[ControlNet|ControlNet]])._ This makes T2I pivotal for doing [[./Style Transfer From Image In Stable Diffusion|Style Transfer From Image In Stable Diffusion]].

### Using T2I

To use T2I, you can download models from [GitHub - TencentARC/T2I-Adapter: T2I-Adapter](https://github.com/TencentARC/T2I-Adapter)

The [ControlNet WebUI Extension](https://github.com/Mikubill/sd-webui-controlnet) (which is just a UI, _not_ the actual [[ControlNet|ControlNet]] models) now supports T2I models as well.
