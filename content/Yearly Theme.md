Yearly Themes are an alternative to New Years Resolutions.

Instead of setting a highly granular goal like "run one mile every day", you set a much larger theme like _order, adventure,_ or _branching out_. 
This theme gives you enough room to find your own goals, interests, and solutions within it. 

Themes allow for your focus to change when you learn what's important and workable, while still making sure you have some domain to focus in. 
Six months into the year you may discover something new. Should you do it? Yes, if it fits the theme. Themes are your [[heuristic|heuristic]] to slice on.

> I like to think of a theme as an overarching tool that you are using to help guide you were thinking over the course of a year. 
> Every day you got 100 million decisions to make about whatever
> With a theme you’re trying to shape those decision. It helps shape in those moments that if there’s like a tie breaker between deciding something one way or another, you should lean in the direction that more closely aligns with your theme

Themes allow for choice, for [[Bottom-Up Design|Bottom-Up Design]]. After the theme is set, _you_ decide (and keep deciding) how to get there.

It’s a [[North Star|North Star]]. A thing that you move towards but never actually reach.

Name should be ‘resonant’. Not logical process, feeling process. What name clicks, makes you feel something.

### Creating Yearly Themes
