Creative output requires long periods of [[Deep Work|Deep Work]] in a state of uninterrupted focus.

Just to build the initial model of what you're doing it takes[[25 To Start|25 To Start]].
From there, you need long uninterrupted periods of time to take a [[Random Walk Through A Graph|Random Walk Through A Graph]], bouncing between things until a creative idea emerges.

A few things can help support this process:

An artists studio or other space where the [[Meez|Meez]] has all the tools & materials you need to work.

Removal of interruptions, digital or physical - things that would jump in to distract you and make you lose the model. Phone notifications, someone asking about the mail, etc.

[[X Or Nothing|X Or Nothing]] sessions to get past the initial hump, since [[The first 25 Minutes Will Feel Like Work|The first 25 Minutes Will Feel Like Work]].
