Atomic Content should only contain a single idea. 

### Principles

It should [[./Atomic Content Should Have Descriptive Names|Should Have A Descriptive Name]] and [[./Atomic Content Should Fit On A Single Page|Fit On A Single Page]].
When it becomes too big, [[Splitting Out Atomic Content|Split It Out]].

### Implementations/Types

- [[Atomic Code|Atomic Code]] - computer code
- [[Atomic Design|Atomic Design]] - design systems
- [[Atomic Notes|Atomic Notes]] - digital notes
- [[./Zettelkasten|Zettelkasten]] - physical notes
- [[Atomic Habits|Atomic Habits]] - basic repeated actions
- [[meme|meme]] - basic unit of ideas

[^1]: Funnily enough, this is fake quote demonstrating the idea. The original quote from a 1933 lecture by Einstein is a lot muddier, and got trimmed down over time. The original text was: ‚ÄúIt can scarcely be denied that the supreme goal of all theory is to make the irreducible basic elements as simple and as few as possible without having to surrender the adequate representation of a single datum of experience.‚Äù
