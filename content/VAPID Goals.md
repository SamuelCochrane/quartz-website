The inverse of [[SMART Goals|SMART Goals]].

If you want to minimize the chances of ever achieving a [[goal|goal]], make sure it's as vapid as possible.

>[!example] "I will clean the whole house today"
>_Vague_ - no specific definition of what "clean" means. Vacuum? Sort? Do laundry?
>_Amorphous_ - not measurable. how do you know you're 25% done with cleaning the house?
>_Pie in the sky_ - cleaning the entire house is a ton of work. Even a trained maid can't do everything in a day.
>_Irrelevant_ - is every part of the house really needed? Or could we just start with the laundry room
>_Delayed_ - Eh, I'll do it tomorrow instead.
