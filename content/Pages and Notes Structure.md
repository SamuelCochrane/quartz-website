title: Pages and Notes Structure
---

A [[model|model]] for how to structure a [[./Zettelkasten|Zettelkasten]].

- Note = content. Short in length (a few paragraphs), covering one [[./Atomic Content|Atomic]] idea. 

- Page = Skeleton. Links to content, but no content itself. Just a scaffold to plug things into. Think: the table of contents. A [[./Linear Walkthrough|Linear Walkthrough]].

A page is the molecule that connects your [[Atomic Notes|Atomic Note]]s.
A page is the skill-tree. Notes are the skills.

%%[[./assets/images/Pages and Notes Structure 2023-05-02 19.43.06.svg|ðŸ–‹ Edit in Excalidraw]], and the [[Pages and Notes Structure 2023-05-02 19.43.06.excalidraw.dark.png|dark exported image]]%%

Pages will end up looking quite long (they can be entire books), but under the hood are quite small - just scaffolding with embeds to the actual content.

A page can be created before the notes themselves, like starting a book by creating the Table Of Contents to help structure how you want it to flow.

Pages can also be bottom-up, representing a [[Random Walk Through A Graph|Random Walk Through A Graph]] you underwent. Maybe just clicking through eight random notes via backlinks and references creates a interesting [[Narrative|Narrative]] which deserves to be its own page.
