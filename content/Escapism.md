Escapism is the Flight in [[The Five Fs|The Five Fs]]. If I can't take my body somewhere away from this [[Pain & Pleasure|Pain]], I can at least take my mind.

Distraction creates relief from unpleasant realities. 

Like most [[./Maladaptive Coping Mechanism|Maladaptive Coping Mechanism]]s, it doesn't do much to actually remove the source of the pain in the first place.

To qualify, it just needs to be complex enough to take up your limited working memory. With your focus elsewhere, you temporarily forget the pain exists.

Like most ways of [[Dealing With Pain|Dealing With Pain]], the quicker the better. [[Pain Demands An Immediate Solution|Pain Demands An Immediate Solution]]. 

So, the quick-hit of [[Outrage Porn|Outrage Porn]] on social media or [[Porn|Actual Porn]] are common solutions.

Going inward is also common. [[Daydreaming|Daydreaming]] complex scenarios (like rehearsing arguments in the shower). Focusing on a hobby project you never intend to [[Publish|Publish]]. 

So long as it offers enough depth that your mind can focus on [[It Takes 25 Minutes To Build The Model|Building The Model]], it will force you to forget whatever was causing you pain earlier.
