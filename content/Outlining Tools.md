title: Outlining Tools
---

Slightly different to a [[./Digital Garden|Digital Garden]] or [[./Zettelkasten|Zettelkasten]] tool. Outlining tools focus on block-level links instead of file-level links. **For outliners, each bullet-point is its own entity.** 

Examples include [[RemNote|RemNote]] and [[Roam Research|Roam Research]].

The creators of [[Obsidian|Obsidian]] have stated it is not an outliner. They have created a similar product, [[Dynalist|Dynalist]], for this reason.
