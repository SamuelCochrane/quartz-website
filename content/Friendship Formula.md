_The Like-Switch_ details a simple formula for [[Making Friends|Making Friends]].

> [!danger] Friendship = Proximity + (Frequency x Duration) + Intensity  

To the degree you have these things, you are friends.

**Proximity** - how physically close / the "bandwidth" of the connection
- Low: texting
- Medium: video chatting
- High: cuddling

**Frequency** - how often you connect
- Low: catching up with a friend from highschool
- High: a coworker or spouse

**Duration** - how long you spend together
- Low: chatting with the barista 
- High: traveling together

**Intensity** - how engaging the interaction is
- Low: sending a reaction to a message
- High: spirited conversation

### Discussion

Interactions will score differently across these dimensions.
- Sending memes to each other is high frequency, but low everything else.
- Catching up with someone is low frequency, but high everything else.

Long-distance relationships make Proximity and Intensity difficult. An engaging bout of texting still won't quite do as much as chatting in person, not to mention [[Sex is a core need|sexual needs]]. People in LDRs often get by by increasing Frequency and Duration, like playing video games over discord every night.

You don't need all of these values to be high. 
Plenty of friendships involve meeting up once every few years for several hours of intense catching up and reminiscing. Plenty of others involve low-intensity cohabitation with someone you're comfortable with.

You can have different types of friendships with different people. [[./Relationships Should Be Limited to Dimensions of Mutual Benefit|Relationships Should Be Limited to Dimensions of Mutual Benefit]].
