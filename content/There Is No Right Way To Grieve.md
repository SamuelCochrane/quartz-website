title: There Is No Right Way To Grieve
---

There is not one way you 'should' feel or act when [[./Coping With Loss|Coping With Loss]].

[[Emotional Expression|Emotional Expression]] can happen a variety of ways, and the idea of a 'right' expression of grief is nonsensical.

[[Don't Should All Over Yourself|Don't Should All Over Yourself]]. Some do better with talking, and some with acting â€“ going for a run can be great for [[Processing Pain|Processing The Pain]].

Don't worry about being 'bipolar' either. It can be normal to quickly go from feeling joy about a happy memory you shared to sadness/anger at another memory. Such emotional flexibility is actually positive.
