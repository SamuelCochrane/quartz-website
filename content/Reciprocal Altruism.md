### Strategy

AnÂ [[Agent|Agent]]Â using [[Reciprocal Altruism|Reciprocal Altruism]] will act [[The Meek|Meek]], like a "provokable nice guy". 
- On round 1: Choose to cooperate
- On rounds 2+: Choose whatever your opponent chose last[^1]

In other words, always choose peace until you get screwed, then choose war.

[^1]: There should also be a small random chance of choosing peace no matter what, to break out of infinite negative feedback loops. 

### Discussion

Reciprocal Altruism requires: them to notice, them to care, them to want to act back, them to be able to act back

[[Agent|Agent]]s using Reciprocal Altruism are not "truly selfless". [[Rational Self Interest|Rational Self Interest]] has dictated that being selfless, to the right people, will benefit them - so that's what they do.

Reciprocal Altruism doesn't suggest being kind to everyone, but to those who've shown they know how to cooperate. There's no requirement to be nice to everyone or to sacrifice yourself to "higher causes" that don't personally benefit you. [[Max Stirner|Stirner]] would be proud. 

Benjamin Franklin used Reciprocal Altruism as a way of [[Making Friends|Making Friends]]. By requesting a small favor from a stranger, he entered both of them into the game. Then, once he did his part and paid them back, they now had a relationship built on trust.
