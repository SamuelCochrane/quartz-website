title: Relationships Should Be Limited to Dimensions of Mutual Benefit
---

> 

Generally, you should keep relationships limited to the dimensions in which they are mutually beneficial for both parties.

> [!example]- And They Were Roommates
> How many of us have lost a friend by trying to make them into a roommate? 
> You start to fight about dishes, about who can decorate the living room - about a million things that hadn't been issues for the _years_ you'd known each other.
> It would have been better if you had left the relationship to dimensions where you both benefit (enjoying their conversation & company).
> 
> Someone can be a great friend and a lousy roommate - and that's only an issue when you try and make them into both. 

Each time you consider adding a new dimension, evaluate them from scratch. What does this person bring to the table for _this dimension_. 

- A work friend may not make a good hiking buddy.
- A casual fling may not make a good long-term partner.

**When you limit relationships to areas you mutually benefit, the friction goes away.** 

You stop demanding things from people that they aren't good at. You stop [[People Aren't Projects|Treating People Like Projects]]. 

Instead, you can just enjoy the relationship you _do_ have. 

If the person, or the circumstance, changes so that a dimension is now no longer beneficial, you can drop it without guilt and pain.

If a friend gets into skiing, and you don't like skiing, you have no [[Obliger|Obligation]] to get dragged along in order to be "a good friend". 
If they need help moving furniture, and you don't want to add "help each other move furniture" as a dimension, it's ok to say it's [[Not My Problem|Not My Problem]].

[[Resentful|Resentment]] and [[boredom|boredom]] would make you a lousy friend if you joined, and you know it.
