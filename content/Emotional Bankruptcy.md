Imagining you have two tanks, representing your capacities for pain and joy.

What happens if the joy tank overflows? Well, a [[Manic|Manic]] episode I guess, but essentially not much.

What happens if the pain tank overflows? **Death**, maybe. 
Too much grief can kill people.

This is one of the reasons [[Pain Is Stronger Than Pleasure|Pain Is Stronger Than Pleasure]]. Too much pain is a _lot_ worse than too much pleasure.

### Hitting Bankruptcy

We've probably all seen this or experienced this when someone is a state of grief. Something small going wrong sets them off in a crying fit. 

They aren't crazy for crying about being out of milk, it's just the straw that broke the camel's back.

### Playing The Game

Wanting something means taking a gamble on the outcome, it means [[./Wanting Something Means Being Disappointed When You Don't Get It|Being Disappointed When You Don't Get It]].
Even if the odds are pretty good, there's always a _chance_ things don't go your way.

### Avoiding The Game

If I'm on the edge of emotional bankruptcy, better not take the risk of a complete breakdown. I don't have the [[table stakes|table stakes]] to even play the game. [[Too Much Pain Stops You From Wanting Things|Too Much Pain Stops You From Wanting Things]]. 

You stop playing the game, taking the gambles for happiness. But that also means no potential for winnings. No potential for joy. [[That path leads ever down into stagnation|That path leads ever down into stagnation]].
