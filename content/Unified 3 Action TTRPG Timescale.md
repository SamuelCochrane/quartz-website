title: Unified 3 Action TTRPG Timescale

Why limit the [[Three Action Economy|Three Action Economy]] to just combat? The same "you can do three things on your turn" system be applied to each mode of [[TTRPG|TTRPG]] play.

%%[[./assets/images/Simplified calendar & time 2024-03-27 12.13.36.svg|üñã Edit in Excalidraw]], and the [[./assets/images/Simplified calendar & time 2024-03-27 12.13.36.excalidraw.dark.png|dark exported image]]%%

Gameplay happens in different modes, each with a different timescale:
- Combat: measured in **seconds**
- Exploration: measured in **minutes**
- Project: measured in **hours**
- Downtime: measured in **days**

Within each scale, you have:
- Action: The shortest trackable action you could make at this scale
- Turn: The max amount a player could do on their turn. Enough time to take [[Three Action Economy|Three Actions]].
- Encounter: The absolute maximum length of time that we should spend at this scale before shifting up/down to a different scale. An entire encounter is the length of a single action at the next scale. (So: one Exploration Action is the length of an entire Combat encounter)

This creates gameplay consistency: no matter the timescale, I know how many things I can do and how to play it.
- Action ‚óà a few _scale_ (1-4 _scale_) 
- Two Actions ‚óà‚óà several _scale_ (4-7 _scale_)
- A Turn ‚óà‚óà‚óà 10 _scale_
- An Encounter ‚ùñ a few _next biggest scale_

Most of the gameplay will take place at the Combat and Exploration levels.
The larger scales act as a "montage sequence" used to jump ahead in the story as far as needed. (Such as recovering from battle, building a house, training, a semester of school, etc.)

If you need to skip ahead a _long_ time, you can go one level even further up.
Long-Term: measured in **months** (1 turn = 1 year).
- ‚óàa few months (1-4 months) (a quarter, a season)
- ‚óà‚óà‚óà 10 working months (a year with 8 weeks off)
- ‚ùñ a few years  (1-4)
